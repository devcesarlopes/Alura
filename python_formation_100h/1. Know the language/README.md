# Know the language

To start, we'll get to know the syntax of the language and some of the new features that came with Python 3. For that, we'll use the PyCharm IDE, which will be where you'll write your code quickly and more efficiently and create your first programs.

In this first part we'll look at the basics of variables, arithmetic and Boolean operators, functions and much more!

Next, we'll look at some basic concepts of the object-oriented paradigm, which is widely used by many libraries and companies in the labor market, and which shows us another way of thinking about code.
