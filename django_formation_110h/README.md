# Python on the web with Django (110h)
Python is a programming language that has grown a lot in recent years as a very flexible and powerful language. In it, we can use the functional or object-oriented paradigms and thus choose the best way to choose within the project we are creating.

Along with the growth of the language, a series of tools were created that are used in day-to-day development. Among them Django which is a high level web framework that encourages rapid development of web applications.

For being of high level this framework abstracts a series of complications present when making a site with back-end and front-end. Using Django we will learn about the MVC pattern, Route separation and how to persist data using an ORM. We will also see how to create a template for viewing this information.
